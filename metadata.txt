about=The QuickPrint plug-in provides a simple way to quickly create a pdf or an image (png) from the map as shown in the map pane. 

    The map is not just a screenshot, but a real map with a title, subtitle, scalebar, date, attribution and remarks. In this way you get a decent print without the hassle of setting up and using print templates. 

    You can choose between A3 and A4 (or ANSI-A and ANSI-B) paper sizes and between portrait and landscape paper orientation.

    Some customizations are possible, like putting a logo or north arrow on the page and setting a different font and font size. It is also possible to set a default attribution and a default remark.
    
    A preview is shown in order to make clear how the map will look before it is actually saved.
