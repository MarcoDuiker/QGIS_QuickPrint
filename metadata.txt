about=The QuickPrint plug-in provides a simple way to quickly create a pdf from the map as shown in the map pane. 

    The map is not just a screenshot, but a real map with a title, subtitle, scalebar, date, attribution and remarks. In this way you get a decent print without the hassle of setting up and using print templates. 

    You can choose between A3 and A4 paper sizes and between portrait and landscape paper orientation.
