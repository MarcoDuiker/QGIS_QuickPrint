About
=====

This plug-in is developed by Marco Duiker from `MD-kwadraat <http://www.md-kwadraat.nl/>`_ .

The plug-in provides a simple way to quickly create a pdf from the map as shown in the map pane. The map is not just a screenshot, but a real map with a title, subtitle, scalebar, date, attribution and remarks. 

In this way you get a decent print without the hassle of setting up and using print templates.

As simple things go it is pretty much self-explanatory.

You can choose between A3 and A4 paper sizes and between portrait and landscape paper orientation.

The only really useful information you can gather from this help is the way you can get a logo on the page.

Putting your logo on the page
=============================

If you want your logo to appear on the page, put a logo.png in the plugins img folder. It will appear in the top righthand corner of all prints you make.

North Arrow
===========

Some people insist on putting a north pointing arrow on a map, even if the map is oriented to the north. If you want to do so, you can put an image of a north arrow on the page instead of your logo. 

Beware, the north arrow will not rotate if you rotate the map.
