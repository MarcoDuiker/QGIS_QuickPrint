QGIS QuickPrint Plugin
==============

The QGIS QuickPrint plug-in provides a simple way to quickly create a pdf or png from the map as shown in the map pane. The map is not just a screenshot, but a real map with a title, subtitle, scalebar, date, attribution, remarks, an optional north arrow and an optional logo.

In this way you get a decent print without the hassle of setting up and using print templates. 

You can choose between A3 and A4 paper sizes and between portrait and landscape paper orientation.

A preview is shown and updated whenever map or the annotations are changed.

Via the settings you can change font and font size, date formatting and add a logo to the map. A default attribution and remark can also be set. This is explained in the [help](https://marcoduiker.github.io/QGIS_QuickPrint/help/build/html/introduction.html). 

Please refer to metadata.txt for source code repository and bug tracking.
