QGIS QuickPrint Plugin
==============

The QGIS QuickPrint plug-in provides a simple way to quickly create a pdf from the map as shown in the map pane. The map is not just a screenshot, but a real map with a title, subtitle, scalebar, date, attribution and remarks.

In this way you get a decent print without the hassle of setting up and using print templates. 

You can choose between A3 and A4 paper sizes and between portrait and landscape paper orientation.

How to add your logo is explained in the [help](https://marcoduiker.github.io/QGIS_QuickPrint/help/build/html/introduction.html). 

Please refer to metadata.txt for source code repository and bug tracking.
